# COVID-19-Research-at-American-Museum-of-Natural-History
These files contain examined CDC public data sets. Files contain various data visualizations, including bar graphs, choropleth maps, and line plots, using Python to investigate trends in COVID-19 mortality rates, positivity rates, and vaccination rates. Additionally, some plots utilize object oriented programming and machine learning techniques to predict U.S. COVID-19 cases and mortality over time. Such data was displayed on a website created with HTML5 and CSS, with the addition of an IBM Watson chatbot that provides users with basic COVID-19 information, including safety precautions. The findings were presented at a symposium attended by public health researchers at the American Museum of Natural History.
