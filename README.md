# PROJECT PURPOSE
Our project's mission is to...
- Gain an epidemiological understanding of the pandemic using live datasets from accredited sources.

- Promote healthy social habits, and spread awareness of risk factors and symptoms associated with COVID-19.

- Learn and practice good principles of ethics for computer science in the real world.

# PROJECT FEATURES
- Choropleth_positivity_rates
- covid19_choropleth
- covid-19 chatbot: A chatbot built using IBM Watson that informs the user and answers covid-19 related questions. 

# LANGUAGE 
- We use mostly Python 3 for our project. Python is a high-level programming language with a wide range of uses, making it ideal for what we plan to do. In the future, we plan to use HTML and CSS in creating a website to host our findings.

# SOURCES 
- OWID
 * We utilized a [csv file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv) from the *Our World in Data Repository*. This data updates depending on when the countries provide them. 
 * OWID uses reliable data from [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) to provide data like cases, death, postitivity rates and more.
