            <h2 class = "question">What is a pandemic?</h2> 
                <p class = "blurb">A pandemic is an event where there is a disease or a virus that spreads across different countries. A pandemic leads to a number of people being affected during the time when the disease/virus isn't controlled. During a pandemic, there could be a shut down to keep the people in that area safe and to stop the spread of infection.</p>

            <h2 class = "question">What is COVID-19?</h2>
            <p class = "blurb"> Coronaviruses are a type of virus that cause upper respiratory tract illnesses in human beings. There are different types of coronaviruses but only seven coronaviruses are known to cause diseases in humans.</p>

            <h2 class = "question">Our Mission</h2>
            <p class = "blurb">Our project mission was to make a platform that can serve as an COVID-19 information site that will be available to the public. We thought that this will be a good idea to spread an awareness about the coronaviruses. In our project you will learn what the virus is and how it affected people through our code.  People are very essential in a pandemic. Thats why informing people about the whats going on is very important. With effective communication going on it will generate more ideas and more data on how to stop the spread of the virus. In our webstie we will show visualizations off of data from COVID-19 cases you wouldn't see on other websites.</p>
