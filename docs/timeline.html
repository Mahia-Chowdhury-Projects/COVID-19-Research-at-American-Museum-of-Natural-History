          <h1 class = "topic">Conclusion</h1>
          <h2 class = "question">Are countries (US or other) doing enough for their civilians and what can leadership do to slow the spread of infection from this point on?</h2>. 
        
          <p class= "blurb">Yes, countries are doing enough to keep civilians out of harm from the coronavirus. Though some countries might have different rules than others. They still expect that the people should be vaccinated or take the test. <a href= “https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/what-weve-learned-about-leadership-from-the-covid-19-pandemic”, target="_blank"> “All countries can still change the course of this pandemic,” if they put resources toward detecting, testing for, and tracing cases of COVID-19, as well as mobilizing their citizens to respond to the virus, he said.” Two countries that lower down the spread of COVID-19 were Asia and New Zealand. For New Zealand they had a four-stage lockdown system to stop the health crisis. Nations in Asia help there people by having/managing the disease. </a> </p>
          <br>
          <h2 class = "question"> Are there examples of systemic inequities within countries with regards to the pandemic?</h2>
          <p class= "blurb"> There are clear systemic inequalities in the United States in regards to the pandemic, since black and brown communities were disproportionately affected from the virus. According to Harmeet Kaur in the article <a href=“https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/08/us/coronavirus-pandemic-race-impact-trnd/index.html”, target =“_blank”> “The coronavirus pandemic is hitting black and brown Americans especially hard on all fronts,” an analysis from the American Public Media (APM) Research Lab stated that 17,155  black Americans were reported to have died from COVID-19. This means that although black Americans make up about 13% of the population in the places that were studied by the lab, they made up 27% of COVID-19 deaths. Similar disproportionate death rates are shown with the Hispanic community, since they only were 18% of the studied population but made up 16% of deaths. This sharply contrasts with the reported COVID-19 deaths of white residents, who were 62% of the population and made up 49% of the COVID-19 deaths. </a> Discrmination is one of the many factors that has led to these disproportionate effects. According to the CDC in their article <a href=“https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/race-ethnicity.htm”, target=“_blank”> Health Equity Considerations and Racial and Ethnic Minority Groups,” </a> racism and other forms of dicrmination exist in the healthcare and housing systems, and can lead to chronic stress, which puts ethnic minority groups more at risk of COVID-19. Alla Katsnelson portrays such disparities in the article <a href= “https://cen.acs.org/analytical-chemistry/diagnostics/Pulse-oximeters-show-racial-disparities/99/i1” , target = “_blank”> “Pulse oximeters are less accurate for Black people” </a> by stating that pulse oximeters, which calculate the oxygen level in a person's blood, often “overestimate oxygen levels in Black people.” This error is alarming, especially during COVID-19, since healthcare workers use this device to determine “whether a patient should be hospitalized or receive supplemental oxygen.” Other interconnected factors such as occupation; educational, income, and wealth gaps; and housing all contributed to these systematic disparities. 
          <br> 
          COVID-19’s second wave over India has led the number of cases in India to exponentially increase. This is due to the large financial disparities in India, where much of the healthcare centers in underserved communities provide ineffective service and undercount the deaths. Another major factor that led to this outbreak is the lack of education within many communities in India. Rather than taking the necessary COVID-19 precautions, residents relied on homemade remedies. However, instead of disproving these memories and encouraging the public to take these necessary steps, according to Rahul Bhatia in the article <a href= “https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/indias-epidemic-of-false-covid-19-information”, target= “_blank”> “India’s Epidemic of False COVID-19 Information,” </a> the briefings held by the ministry of health consisted of denialism and a reluctance to share information. 
 </p>
        <h2 class =" question"> Why was each component of our project an important contribution to an eventual resolve? Is there a solution to the problems addressed above?
        </h2>
        <p class = "blurb">We hope that each component of our project is an important contribution to the eventual resolve of such issues. Our choropleth maps that depict COVID-19 deaths and fatality rates in the US and positivity rates around the globe, can be used to analyze which states/countries are disproportionately affected by the virus. After determining this the specific factors that lead to these disparities can be further-analyzed, so that the obstacles within these areas can be resolved overtime. Our prediction model for the fully vaccinated rates can help ensure that the government and healthcare facilities of the US have consistent vaccination rates and that they do not plummet. 
        <br>
          Unfortunately, there is a no definite solution to the problems addressed above because they are linked to several systemic factors, which stem from histories of oppression and exploitation. Nonetheless, the US and other countries, can work on strategies to make resources more equitable throughout their countries.
